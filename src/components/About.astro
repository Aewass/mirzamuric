        My programming journey began in elementary school, where I took my first steps with BASIC, sparking an early interest in technology. Even managed to end up 3rd in a local programming competition against other kids that were using C++. To this day I still can't figure why our teacher didn't let us use C++.

        In high school, I had the opportunity to explore web development through coursework, learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although my path then led me away from programming for several years, my interest in technology never faded.

      There's more to life than writing code. When I'm not behind the keyboard, you'll find me scaling mountain peaks, exploring new trails, and capturing nature's beauty through my lens. These adventures not only fuel my creativity but also bring fresh perspectives to my work.
