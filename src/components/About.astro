          My programming journey began in elementary school, where I took my first steps with BASIC, sparking an early interest in technology. Even managed to end up 3rd in a local programming competition against other kids that were using C++. To this day I still can't figure why our teacher didn't let us use C++.

        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-16">
          In high school, I had the opportunity to explore web development through coursework, learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although my path then led me away from programming for several years, my interest in technology never faded.

        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-16">
          After college, I found my way back to my programming when I accepted a position as a web developer at TNTSoft, where I've been able to fully commit myself to the craft.
