I recently created a fun and experimental NPM package called [bosnian-css-preprocessor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bosnian-css-preprocessor) that allows developers to write CSS using Bosnian language properties.

## What Does It Do?

The package provides a simple way to write CSS properties using Bosnian words. Common properties like 'width' become 'sirina', 'height' becomes 'visina', and 'background-color' becomes 'boja-pozadine'. The preprocessor then transforms these Bosnian properties into standard CSS that browsers can understand.

## Why Create This?

While this package might seem like a novelty, it raises interesting questions about programming language accessibility. Not everyone is comfortable with English, and ideas like this can help:

1. Make learning CSS more approachable for non-English speakers
2. Demonstrate how preprocessors work
3. Learn more about how to build and maintain multilingual projects

## Learning Through Building

Creating this package taught me lessons about:

- The importance of clear documentation in open-source projects
- How preprocessors and transpilers work under the hood
- The challenges of maintaining multilingual support in development tools

## Getting Started

The package is available on NPM and can be easily installed using npm or yarn. Once installed, it provides a simple transform function that converts your Bosnian CSS into standard CSS. Check out the [NPM package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bosnian-css-preprocessor) for full documentation and usage examples.

Remember, sometimes the most interesting projects come from simply asking "What if?" and building something fun!
